### About this course

This is an action-packed specialization for data science enthusiasts who want to acquire practical skills for real world data problems. It appeals to anyone interested in pursuing a career in Data Science, and already has the foundational skills. You will learn Python - no prior programming knowledge necessary. You will then learn data visualization and data analysis. Through the guided lectures, labs, and projects you’ll get hands-on experience tackling interesting data problems. 

### Key takeaways of this course?

This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, probability, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you’ll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.
